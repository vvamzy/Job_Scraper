# Job_Scraper
This project is a powerful web scraping tool designed to extract job listings from Naukri.com, specifically targeting roles that match a desired experience range. It leverages Selenium for dynamic content fetching and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. The extracted data is saved in a CSV file with clickable job titles that directly link.
